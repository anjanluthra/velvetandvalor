        <h2 class="page-section-title">1. About Us &amp; These Terms</h2>
        <p class="page-body">
          These terms of sale (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) govern the contract between Velvet &amp; Valor Ltd (&ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;) and you when you purchase products from our website. Please read them carefully before placing an order. By placing an order, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
        </p>
        <p class="page-body">
          Velvet &amp; Valor Ltd is a company registered in the United Arab Emirates.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="page-section">
        <h2 class="page-section-title">2. Your Order</h2>
        <p class="page-body">
          When you place an order, you are making an offer to purchase the product(s) described at the price shown. We will send you an order confirmation email, but this does not constitute our acceptance of your order. A binding contract is formed only when we dispatch the goods and send you a dispatch confirmation.
        </p>
        <p class="page-body">
          We reserve the right to refuse or cancel any order at our discretion, including where goods are out of stock, we cannot verify payment, or we suspect fraudulent activity. In such cases, we will refund any payment already taken in full.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="page-section">
        <h2 class="page-section-title">3. Pricing &amp; Payment</h2>
        <p class="page-body">
          All prices shown are in British Pounds Sterling (GBP) and include UK VAT where applicable. For international orders, local import duties and taxes may apply and are the buyer's responsibility.
        </p>
        <p class="page-body">
          Payment is taken at the time of order via Stripe. We accept major credit and debit cards. We do not store your card details.
        </p>
        <p class="page-body">
          We reserve the right to correct pricing errors. If an error affects your order, we will contact you before proceeding and you will have the option to confirm the order at the correct price or cancel it for a full refund.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="page-section">
        <h2 class="page-section-title">4. Products &amp; Descriptions</h2>
        <p class="page-body">
          We take care to describe our products accurately. However, because our cases are made from natural full-grain leather, there will be natural variations in grain, texture, and colour between individual pieces — this is a feature of the material, not a defect.
        </p>
        <p class="page-body">
          Product images are representative. Due to screen calibration and the natural variation of leather, colours and textures may appear slightly different in person. If you have questions about a specific product, please contact us before ordering.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="page-section">
        <h2 class="page-section-title">5. Personalisation &amp; Engraving</h2>
        <p class="page-body">
          If you order a personalised item (including engraving), you are responsible for checking and confirming the text you submit. We will engrave exactly what you have written, including capitalisation and spacing.
        </p>
        <p class="page-body">
          <strong>Personalised items cannot be returned or exchanged unless they are defective.</strong> Please ensure you are fully satisfied with your engraving text before placing your order. We are unable to make amendments after an order has entered production.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="page-section">
        <h2 class="page-section-title">6. Delivery</h2>
        <p class="page-body">

          Risk in the goods passes to you upon delivery. Title passes when payment is received in full.
